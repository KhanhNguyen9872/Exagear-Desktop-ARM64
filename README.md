ExaGear Desktop is a virtual machine that implements a virtual x86 Linux container on ARM-based mini PCs, enabling the direct and simultaneous running of both x86 Linux and native applications.

Well it's discontinued now and there's packages stored in the repository. It still works well after some fixes.
